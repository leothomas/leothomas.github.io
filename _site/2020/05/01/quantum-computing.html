<p>
    In my last year at McGill (2017), I did a research project in quantum computation with Dr.
    Michael Hilke, head of the McGill Quantum NanoElectronic’s Laboratory. The point of the project
    was to analyse the effect of random disorder on qubit entanglement.
</p>
<p>
    Before getting into the simulation itself, I want to briefly go over a couple important concepts
    in quantum computing: <strong>superposition</strong> and <strong>entanglement</strong>. (If
    you're already familiar with these, feel free to skip ahead!)
</p>
<h5>
    Superposition:
</h5>
<p>
    Superposition is the idea that a quantum particle can exist in multiple states at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    In a regular computer, the most basic unit of information - called a bit - can be in one of two
    states: 0 or 1.
</p>
<p>
    In a quantum computer, the most basic unit of information - called a qubit - is a particle in a
    quantum state, that can be described as a linear combination of the two basic states:
    |&nbsp;0&nbsp;&#8250; and |&nbsp;1&nbsp;&#8250;.
</p>
<p>
    The "&nbsp;|&nbsp;&#8250;&nbsp" notation is a mathematical notation used to describe quantum
    states, called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation">
        BraKet notation - or Dirac Notation
    </a>. |&nbsp;0&nbsp;&#8250; indicates a quantum state that would collapse to the
    classical state 0 if it were measured, and |&nbsp;1&nbsp;&#8250; indicates a quantum state that
    would collapse to the classical state 1, if it were measured.
</p>
<p>
    One way to think about quantum particle states it to imagine the particle inside of a box.
    At any given moment, the exact state of the particle cannot be precisely known without measuring
    it. The act of measuring it causes the particle's state to collapse into a classical state (0 or
    1). Without measuring the particle's state, the only thing that <strong>can</strong> be known
    precisely is the <strong>probability</strong> of the particle collapsing into one state or the
    other, if were measured at that moment. (This is the concept explained by the
    Schrödinger's cat analogy: a cat is in a box with a radioactive source; since we cannot know
    whether the cat is dead or alive at any given moment, the act of opening the box amounts to
    killing - or saving - the cat.)
</p>

<p>
    The linear combination, or superposition, of states that describes the state of a quantum
    particle can be represented mathematically as:
</p>
<p>
    |&nbsp;&#968;&nbsp;&#8250;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#945;&nbsp;|&nbsp;0&nbsp;&#8250;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&#946;&nbsp;|&nbsp;1&nbsp;&#8250;&nbsp;,
    where &#945; and &#946; are complex numbers.

</p>
<p>
    If the qubit were measured, it would be found in state |&nbsp;0&nbsp;&#8250; with probability
    |&#945;|&#0178; and in state |&nbsp;1&nbsp;&#8250; with probability |&#946;|&#0178;. The
    probability of finding a qubit in one state or another, if it were measured at that moment, is
    called the qubit's expectation value.
</p>

<p>
    Here's a graph from my simulation of the expectation value of a single qubit, as it evolves over
    time.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/quantum-computing/expectation_values_single.jpg"
        alt="Qubit Evolution Expectation values">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Expectation values of a qubit. Note that as the probability of
        it being measured in one state goes to 1.0 the probability of it being measured in the
        other state goes to 0. </span>
</p>

<p>
    In summary, where a classical bit can map to one of 2 values, superposition allows a qubit
    to exist as an infite number of values (as long as it is not measured). You can think of a
    bit as a light switch and a qubit as pointing to anywhere on surface of a sphere:

        qubits</span>
</p>
<p>
    <h5>
        Entanglement:
    </h5>

    When two qubits are entangled, the state of one qubit affects the sate of another qubit,
    regardless of where the qubits are or how far appart they are.
</p>
<p>
    To illustrate, take two qubits entangled in an equal superposition, meaning either both are in
    the |&nbsp;0&nbsp;&#8250; state or both are in the |&nbsp;1&nbsp;&#8250; state -
    denoted |&nbsp;00&nbsp;&#8250; and |&nbsp;11&nbsp;&#8250;, respectively. The state of this
    system of qubits is mathematically represented as: <br />
</p>
<p>
    | &#968; &#8250; = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>&#8730;2</sub> ( |&nbsp;00&nbsp;&#8250; +
    |&nbsp;11&nbsp;&#8250; )
</p>
<p>
    In this case the states |&nbsp;00&nbsp;&#8250; and |&nbsp;11&nbsp;&#8250; are equally probable
    (( <sup>1</sup>/<sub>&#8730;2</sub>)&#0178; = 0.5, the system has a 50% chance of being
    chance of being found in either state).

</p>
<p>
    If one qubit is found to be in the |&nbsp;0&nbsp;&#8250; state then the other must
    <strong>necessarily</strong> be in the |&nbsp;0&nbsp;&#8250; state and if one is found to be in
    the |&nbsp;1&nbsp;&#8250; state then the other must be in the |&nbsp;1&nbsp;&#8250; state (since
    the only two possible states of the entagled system are |&nbsp;00&nbsp;&#8250; and
    |&nbsp;11&nbsp;&#8250;&nbsp;). Incredibly, this is true <strong>regardless</strong> of where the
    qubits are and how far apart they are from each other!
</p>
<p>
    Entaglement is crucial to "quantum 2.0" technologies that use qubit entanglement to improve the
    precision of their measurements. These technologies include improved atomic clocks that keep
    time with an order of magnitude more precision than current leading clocks, as well as electron
    microscopes and satellites.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of quantum computers, qubits must be entangled through a channel, such as a proton
    beam or or fiber optic cable. These channels are prone to disorder, which is almost always
    detrimental to the information transfer between the entangled particles. Electromagnetic signals
    from nearby machinery and background radiation are two common culprits. These kinds of disorder
    are called dynamic, or time dependent, and can be modeled mathematically. They are well studied,
    and correction schemes have been developed to mitigate their effects.

</p>
<p>
    My project was concerned with non-time dependent disorder, or static disorder, such as
    impurities in the air or in a fiber optic cable. Due to their highly random nature, these kinds
    of disorder cannot be modeled mathematically, and are much harder to account for. The goal of my
    project was to develop a python simulation of entangled particles to quantify how their
    information transfer was affected when random disorder is introduced to the entanglement
    channel.
</p>

<h3>The simulation</h3>
<p>
    The simulation starts with the famous Schrödinger equation, which describes the states of
    quantum systems. If you are interested in a slightly more in-depth explanation of the quantum
    theory behind the simulation, please feel free to check out the
    <strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V2eJxy9jgibWXy9N4vlC5e-BQ0p_6JU2/view">
            paper</a></strong> itself!
</p>
<p>
    For the simulation, we use a mathmatical operator called a Hamiltonian (\(\hat{H}\)), to
    represent the quantum particle:
    $$\hat{H} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \varepsilon_{up} && \tau \\
    \tau^* && \varepsilon_{down}
    \end{bmatrix}$$
    (\(\varepsilon_{up}\), \(\varepsilon_{down}\) have to do with the energy of the quantum
    particle, and vary between 0 and 1, and \(\tau\) is not very important within the scope of this
    post)
</p>
<p>
    The Hamiltonian operator makes it straightforward to mathematically represent the particles as
    they become entangled, by using an operation called the Kronecker product (\(\otimes\)). The
    Kronecker product simply multiplies each element of the first matrix by the entire second
    matrix:
    $$\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} \\
    a_{11} & a_{22} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \otimes
    \begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} & b_{12} \\
    b_{11} & b_{22} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} {\begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} & b_{12} \\
    b_{11} & b_{22} \\
    \end{bmatrix}} & a_{12} {\begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} & b_{12} \\
    b_{11} & b_{22} \\
    \end{bmatrix}} \\
    a_{21} {\begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} & b_{12} \\
    b_{11} & b_{22} \\
    \end{bmatrix}} & a_{22} {\begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} & b_{12} \\
    b_{11} & b_{22} \\
    \end{bmatrix}} \\
    \end{bmatrix}$$
</p>

<p>
    In order to represent two entangled qubits - let's call them A and B - we calculate:
    $$ \hat{H}_A \otimes \hat{H}_B $$

</p>
<p>
    In order to represent qubit entangled through a channel, we simply construct a chain
    of entangled quantum particles. We Kronecker product to entangle each qubit to the
    next and then consider the ones on either extremity to be the entangled particles we want to
    study, and the rest to be part of the channel.
</p>
<p>
    Once we have a mathematical representation of the qubits entangled through a channel, we add
    some random disturbance to the entanglement channel and see how the qubits on either end act
    differently from when there is no energy in the channel.
</p>
<p>
    The Hamiltonian operator that represents the qubits and their entanglement channel is used to
    find a solution to the Schrödinger equation (using a propagator known as the
    <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_11/papers/jeff.pdf"> Green function</a>).
    This solution is energy dependent, meaning it defines state of the system with
    respect to the particles' energy. In order to describe the system's state as it
    evolves over time we use an operation known as a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier Transform</a> to describe the
    system's state as it evolves over time. The result of this transform is the expectation values
    of two entangled qubits time:
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/quantum-computing/coupled-qubits-expectation-values.jpg"
        alt="Expectation values of Entangled Qubits">
    <span class="caption text-muted">Time evolution of the expectation values of two entangled
        qubits
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    Notice that each qubit's expectation values oscilate between 0 and 1.0, at a different rate.
    These oscillations will come in and out of phase and at certain times, will be anti-phased (one
    qubit's expectation value reaches 1.0 at the same time as the other reaches 0). When the
    expectation values are anti-phased their oscillations become restricted, as we see around
    time t=25. If the particles were not entangled, their expectation values would simultaneously
    reach 100% probability of being found in opposite states (|&nbsp;10&nbsp;&#8250; or
    |&nbsp;01&nbsp;&#8250;). However, since such states are prohibited by the entanglement, the
    expectation values of both qubits are restricted to 0.5 around time t=25. The expectation values
    recover their full oscillation as the system comes out of this anti-phased state, and the
    expectation values no longer simultaneously reach 100% probability of being found
    in opposite states.
</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
    In this project, I tackled the question: how does static disorder in quantum entanglement
    channels
    affect information transfer between qubits? The answer: it does.
</p>
<p>
    The graph below shows the average difference between the expectation values of qubits entangled
    through a disordered channel and those of a non-entangled qubit, at different disorder ranges
    (eg: a disorder range of 0.25 means the qubits forming the entanglement channel have been
    assigned random energy values between -0.25 and 0.25). We notice that as that disorder range
    increases, the qubit behaves less and less like an entangled qubit and more like an isolated
    qubit.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/quantum-computing/average_difference_entangled.jpeg"
        alt="Average Difference">
    <span class="caption text-muted">The average difference of qubit expectation values over 31
        trials. Notice a sharp drop off at the disorder range value 0.5 (marked with a red line).
        This is likely due to the fact that at that point disorder range (-0.5 to 0.5) exceeds the
        channel width (1.0), and starts blocksing the qubits from communicating effectively,
        eventually leading to a system where the qubits are almost entorely isolated (at disorder
        range 1.5)
    </span>
</p>

<p>
    While this may seem like a rather underwhelming result because it's exactly what we would
    intuitively expect, this project created and validated a framework for modeling the
    behaviours of entangled quantum particles. This kind of framework can be very useful in many
    other quantum computing research applications.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, we can't begin to quantify the effect of disorder on quantum systems if we have not
    proved that it does affect the system in the first place. Simulations like these are much
    cheaper and easier to run than physical experiments involving quantum particles, and are a great
    starting point for further research.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of this project a great next step would to be find other metrics to quantify the
    difference in behaviour between the entangled qubit and the isolated qubit, other than just the
    difference in their expectation values. Another good subject to further research would be the
    rate of decoupling in quantum systems with large disorder values.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    My experience with quantum computing was incredibly rewarding (albeit stressful due to time
    constraints). I was very proud to achieve some results, as basic and obvious as they may have
    beenm, they were correct and valid! Ever since I have been fascinated with the idea of modeling
    the world around us.
